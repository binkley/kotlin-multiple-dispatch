# Kotlin Multiple Dispatch

This code is a "finger exercise"&mdash;written for pleasure&mdash;of examples
for simulating multiple dispatch in Kotlin.

## Build and try

To build, use `./mvnw clean verify`.

Try `./run` for a demonstration.

There are no run-time dependencies beyond the Kotlin standard library.

To build as CI would, use `./batect build`.

Try `./batect run` for a demonstration as CI would.
